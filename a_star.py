'''
    The algorithm uses a PriorityQueue data structure which can be represented as the following loop:

    student = []
    student.append((5, 'Nick'))
    student.append((1, 'Rohan'))
    student.append((3, 'Jack'))
    student.sort(reverse=True)
    while student:
        t = student.pop()
        print(t)

    Output:  â€œ (1, 'Rohan') (3, 'Jack') (5, 'Nick')

    Instead of dequeuing the oldest element, PriorityQueue sorts and dequeues elements based on their priorities
    .get() method returns the element with the lowest priority
    In this case - f(n) score
